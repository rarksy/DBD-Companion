# Dead By Daylight Companion

The DBD Companion is a tool that houses all things to assist your experience and gameplay!

# Feature: Hook Counter

Ever forget how many hooks each survivor has when playing killer? With the hook counter you can track exactly that! 
Using image template matching you can now rely on an overlay to display how many hooks each survivor has.

Modes:
Single Stage Tracking | Input any text in the hook counter and have it displayed next to each survivor when hooked!

Multi Stage Tracking  | Text is replaced with tally marks next to each survivor representing their hook state like on survivor!

# Feature: Config Editor

Since Dead By Daylights in game graphics suck i created a config editor that you can use to individually manage each setting.

Settings include:
- View Distance
- Anti Aliasing
- Foliage Quality
- Shading Quality
- Shadow Quality
- Post Processing
- Animation Quality (A-LOD)
- Resolution Quality
- Texture Quality
- Effects Quality
- Unlock FPS
- Toggle VSync
- Toggle Motion Blur
- Toggle Bloom
- Toggle Lens Flare
- Toggle Ambient Occlusion

Other Options:
- 1:1 Sensitivity (Vertical killer sensitivity is slower than horizontal, this fixes that) | Credits to [gtVel](https://twitch.tv/gtvel) for providing info on this
- Export Config (Backup)
- Copy Config To Clipboard (BASE-64 Encoded) (Used to share config settings with anyone)
- Inject Config From Clipboard (used to apply settings copied from clipboard)
